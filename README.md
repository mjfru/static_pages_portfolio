# Welcome to my Front-end Portfolio
## Here, I'll be uploading any projects I'm working on that include mostly **HTML**, **CSS**, and some **minor JavaScript**.
As I upload, I'll create a section here describing each project and my purpose for making it. Projects listed alphabetically; hope you enjoy.

  + Animation Samples - A collection of applicable, everyday animations made to practice animations and transitions.
  + Artist Portfolio - A portfolio / gallery page for an artist. This was done to practice positioning without flexbox or flexgrid. Fully responsive with only HTML & CSS.
  + Cantilever - A fully responsive advertisement for a coding conference. Focus here was on line spacing and adding a decorative flourish with text-shadow. All HTML & CSS.
  + CV Project - A CV template which was made to practice using rems for font-sizing, vh for larger element heights, and the dreaded float property. Later refactored to incorporate responsive design.
  + Order Summary Page - A simple, receipt-like page showing proof of payment for a subscription service. Made with only HTML & CSS, created to focus on small details and positioning.
  + Portfolio Grid - A mock digital artist's portfolio created to practice page layouts using grid. Fully responsive and made with only HTML & CSS.
  + Swipe - The largest project in this portfolio, Swipe is a mock landing-page for an online payment service. It utilizes semantic HTML, an enormous amount of CSS, including CSS variables, animations, and some JavaScript. (The top animation was provided by a codepen author and then further customized).
  + Web Developer Blog - A fully responsive mock blog for a web developer. Built to practice page sizing with view-height, alignment, and semantic HTML elements.
